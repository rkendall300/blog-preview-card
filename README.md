### Links

- Live Site URL: [Blog Preview](https://rkendall300.github.io/blog-preview-card/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

My main focus of this project was not related to the difficulty of the page, but moreso to get repetition in using Github and GH-Pages to host the project. I plan on doing the rest of the level 1 Frontend Mentor projects to go through the motions of using a github repo.

## Acknowledgments

Once again, thank you to my friend Eric for helping me start this frontend development journey! Also big thanks to @MelvinAguilar for suggesting I use flexbox/grid for centering cards on the middle of the screen like in this project. Not having to work around margins was a very nice quality of life change.
